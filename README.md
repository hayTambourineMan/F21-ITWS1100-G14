## Overview

Our project, DO ITWS, is an online to do list application that helps people keep track of their home tasks and class assignments. It allows users to record daily activities, set up routines, view achievements, and set up deadlines for their tasks. It gives users the ability to set up a schedule for themselves. Our goal for DO ITWS is to provide a friendly and relaxed interface for our peers to set up and maintain a schedule for themselves. We also wish to help our users develop the necessary time management skills by providing them a means to record and keep track of their routines.
